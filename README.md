# Flip-Game


I developed a fun flip card game using React, where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game offers a simple yet engaging challenge, with a playful design to keep things lighthearted. It features dynamic card flipping animations and a responsive layout for all device sizes. Built to provide quick entertainment, the game is easy to play but tricky to master. This project was a great opportunity to enhance my React skills while creating something enjoyable!
